Problem Statement: The Bernstein-Vazirani problem:
    Input: a function f : {0, 1}^n → {0, 1}.
    Assumption: f(x) = a × x + b.
    Output: a, b.
    Notation: {0, 1}^n is the set of bit strings of length n, 
    a is an unknown bit string of length n, × is inner product mod 2, 
    + is addition mod 2, and b is an unknown single bit.  

Implementation Language: Python3
Dependencies: numpy, random
