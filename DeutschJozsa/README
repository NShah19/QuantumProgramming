Problem Statement: The Deutsch-Jozsa problem
    Input: a function f: {0,1}^n â†’ {0,1}.
    Assumption: f is either constant or balanced.
    Output: 1 if f is constant; 0 if f is balanced.
    Notation: {0,1} is the set of bits, and {0,1}^n is the set of bit strings of length n.
    Terminology: 
        Constant: f is constant if either f always outputs 0 or f always outputs 1.
        Balanced: f is balanced if f outputs 0 on exactly half of the inputs.

Implementation Language: Python3
Dependencies: None
